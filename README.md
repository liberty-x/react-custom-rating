## Custom Image Rating

We will be using React to create the component and using the "props" to set the outcome of the image.
eg. {maxRating: 5, rating: 4, image: http://img-src}


### Props to supply

Please use the **exact** spellings:

|Prop name|Prop Type|Description|
|:-------:|:-------:|:---------:|
|```image``` |string|A string of the image's URL|
|```maxRating``` |number|The scale of the rating i.e. if you are rating something 3 out of 10, this value would be 10!|
|```rating``` |number|The rating on the scale i.e. if you are rating something 3 out of 10, this value would be 3!|
